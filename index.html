    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Context hint:</strong> A lot of jobs require someone who can
            think on their feet or present ideas with crispness and clarity. This
            question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills,
            your personality and your ability to respond to an unstructured
            question.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-your-greatest-strength-">

    <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Context hint:</strong> Employers want to see if you can strike
        the right balance between confidence and humility. Hiring managers also
        want to get a sense for how self-aware and honest you are and align your
        strengths to the role at hand.

        is a place you can showcase what you‚Äôre doing to improve.

    <ul>

            <strong>Context hint:</strong> This question tests how persuasive you
        are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for
        yourself, even if they‚Äôre acting skeptical. They‚Äôre looking for factual
        and compelling answers.
    </li>
    </ul>

        in with the team. This question can also help you highlight your
        strengths without feeling like you‚Äôre bragging.

            <strong>Context hint:</strong> Employers say they want to hire people
        who are running ‚Äúto‚Äù a role as opposed to running ‚Äúaway.‚Äù However, they
        are also interested in your honesty when things haven‚Äôt worked out and
        will give people second chances when they demonstrate hunger.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="describe-your-most-challenging-project">
    Describe your most challenging project
</h2>

            are aligned to what they have budgeted for this role.
